#### Api

No api to mess with. Enter the command and get instant results.

> If you are on Chrome, the tabs will be ordered from most relevant to less relevant (left to right). Please keep your browser open before running the command.

### Raison D'etre
npm packages are super cool. I religiously go to each and open them anyways. So might as well do it with my eyes closed with only one command. This package does the task super well.
